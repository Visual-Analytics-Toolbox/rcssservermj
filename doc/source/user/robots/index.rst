Robot Models
============

Robot Models refer to the physical representation of agents within the simulation.

The simulator ships with a collection of robot models that can be selected by a client.
Upon connecting, clients have to specify the robot model representation of the corresponding agent in the simulation as part of the :ref:`Init Requst <agent-protocol_init-request>`.

Robot model files are located in the '*resources/robots*' directory.
Each robot model is organized in a separate subdirectory named after the model.
